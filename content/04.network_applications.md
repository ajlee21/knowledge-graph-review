### Unifying Techniques

Mapping high dimensional data into a low dimensional space has greatly improved modeling performance in fields such as natural language processing [@arxiv:1301.3781; @arxiv:1310.4546] and image analysis [@arxiv:1512.03385].
The success of these approaches provides rationale for projecting knowledge graphs into a low dimensional space as well [@arxiv:1709.05584].
Techniques that perform this projection often require information on how nodes are connected with one another [@raw:gongreplearn; @doi:10.1109/TKDE.2016.2606098; @raw:hanreplearn; @doi:10.1145/2806416.2806512], while other approaches can work directly with the edges themselves [@arxiv:1610.04073].
We group methods for producing low-dimensional representations of knowledge graphs into the following three categories: matrix factorization, translational methods, and deep learning.

#### Matrix Factorization

1. Mention techniques for these with some papers

#### Translational Distance Models

Translational distance models treat edges in a knowledge graph as linear transformations.
As an example, one such algorithm, TransE [@raw:bordestranse], treats every node-edge pair as a triplet with head nodes represented as $\textbf{h}$, edges represented as $\textbf{r}$, and tail nodes represented as $\textbf{t}$.
These representations are combined into an equation that mimics the iconic word vectors translations ($\textbf{king} - \textbf{man} + \textbf{woman} \approx \textbf{queen}$) from the Word2vec model [@arxiv:1310.4546].
The equation is shown as follows: $\textbf{h} + \textbf{r} \approx \textbf{t}$.
Starting at the head node ($\textbf{h}$), add the edge vector ($\textbf{r}$) and the result should be the tail node ($\textbf{t}$).
TransE optimizes embeddings for $\textbf{h}$, $\textbf{r}$, $\textbf{t}$, while guaranteeing the global equation ($\textbf{h} + \textbf{r} \approx \textbf{t}$) is satisfied [@raw:bordestranse].
A caveat to the TransE approach is that it the training steps force relationships to have a one to one mapping, which may not be appropriate for all types of relationships.

Wang et al. [@raw:wangtransH] attempted to resolve the one to one mapping issue by developing the TransH model.
TransH treats relations as hyperplanes rather than a regular vector and projects the head ($\textbf{h}$) and tail ($\textbf{t}$) nodes onto the hyperplane.
Following this projection, a distance vector ($\textbf{d}_{r}$) is calculated between the projected head and tail nodes.
Finally, each vector is optimized while preserving the global equation ($\textbf{h} + \textbf{d}_{r} \approx \textbf{t}$) [@raw:wangtransH].
Other approaches [@raw:lintransR, @arxiv:1610.04073; @arxiv:1909.00672] have built off of the TransE and TransH models. 
In the future, it may be beneficial for these models is to incorporate other types of information such as edge confidence scores, textual information, or edge type information when optimizing these embeddings.

### Unifying Applications

Knowledge graphs have been used in many biomedical applications ranging from identifying protein functions [@doi:10.1186/s12859-018-2163-9] to prioritizing cancer genes [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty148] to recommending safer drugs to patients [@arxiv:1710.05980; @doi:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33011126] (Figure {@fig:unifying_applications}).
In this section we discuss how knowledge graphs are being applied in biomedical settings. 
We put particular emphasis on an emerging set of techniques: those that project knowledge graphs into a low dimensional space.

#### Multi-Omic Applications

Multi-omic applications consist of studying genes (genomics), RNA (transcriptomics) and proteins (proteomics).
Approaches in this category use knowledge graphs to establish connections between biological entities (genes, RNA, proteins) themselves and diseases via tasks such as gene prioritization [@doi:10.1093/jamia/ocy117], predicting interactions between proteins [@doi:10.1089/cmb.2012.0273;10.1186/1752-0509-9-S1-S9], and detecting MiRNA-disease associations [@doi:10.1155/2017/2498957].
In this section we discuss on multi-omic applications that utilize projecting knowledge graphs into a low dimensional space to make connections.

Knowledge graphs have been used as recommendation systems to establish links between RNA with disease and proteins with other proteins.
Shen et al. [@doi:10.1155/2017/2498957] used an algorithm called collaborative filtering to establish an association between MiRNA and diseases.
The authors constructed an MiRNA-Disease network using the HMDDD database [@doi:10.1093/nar/gky1010] and generated an adjacency matrix with the rows representing MiRNA and the columns representing diseases.
This adjacency matrix was decomposed into small rectangular matrices using SVD, then these matricies were used to calculate similarity scores between the MiRNA and diseases.
High scores implicated a high likelihood that a given MiRNA has an association with a given disease [@doi:10.1155/2017/2498957].
Other approaches have built off of Shen et al.'s [@doi:10.1155/2017/2498957] work by incorpoating novel ways to perform matrix factorization [@doi:10.3390/genes10020080; @doi:10.1186/s12859-019-2956-5;@doi:10.1186/s12859-019-3260-0] or by integrating machine learning models in conjunction with matrix factorization [@doi:10.1109/TCBB.2019.2937774].
These methods provided high AUROCs, but new discoveries were hard to validate as there is limited experimental data [@doi:10.1155/2017/2498957].
Apart from MiRNA, collaborative filtering has been used to predict protein-protein interactions [@doi:10.1109/BIBM.2010.5706537; @doi:10.1089/cmb.2012.0273; @doi:10.1186/1752-0509-9-S1-S9].
Future work could include doing a blinded literature search to increase validation power or incorporate other techniques as deep learning to increase detection power.

Approaches that use deep learning have mainly focused on using the node2vec model [@arxiv:1607.00653] or variants of that model.
Yang et al. [@doi:10.1093/jamia/ocy117] used node2vec to create a recommendation system to infer associations between genes and disease symptoms.
The authors constructed a gene-disease symptom knowledge graph by combining two bipartite graphs: genes-diseases and diseases-disease symptoms.
The generated knowledge graph was embedded via node2vec and similarity scores were calculated for every gene-symptom pair in the graph.
High scores implicated high chance for an association [@doi:10.1093/jamia/ocy117].
This approach outperformed methods that didn't use a knowledge graph; however, validation was difficult as it involved manual curation of the literature @doi:10.1093/jamia/ocy117].
Similar approaches used variants of the node2vec algorithm to predict gene-disease associations
[@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty559; doi:10.3389/fgene.2019.00226 @doi:10.1186/s12920-019-0627-z; @doi:10.1109/BIBM47256.2019.8983134] analyze RNA-seq data [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkx750] and infer novel protein information [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btx275; @doi:10.1007/978-3-030-00825-3_16; @doi:10.1016/j.artmed.2019.04.001; @doi:10.1186/s12859-018-2163-9].
Future extensions of these applications should consider incorporating more sources of data such as compounds, anatomic locations or even gene pathways to improve prediciton performance.

Knowledge graphs have aided the multi-omics field by generating novel discoveries.
Majority of methods have been heavily focused on matrix factorization and node2vec to project knowledge graph into a low dimensional space; however, translational models remain an untapped resource that may benefit the field in future applications.
Also, another area of exploration is to incorporate heterogeneous information such as anatomic locations or genetic pathways into generate networks to improve novel discoveries
