#### Pharmaceutical Applications

Knowledge graphs have added the pharmaceutical world by providing information on drug drug interactions [@doi:10.1016/j.websem.2017.06.002], drug target interactions [@doi:10.1155/2015/275045] and identifying candidate drugs for repurposing [@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726.001].
These knowledge graphs can consist of a homogenous network containing only drugs or can be a heterogenous network that contains other useful drug information.
We discuss approaches that use these knowledge graphs to make pharmaceutical predictions.

Drug Target applications involve using knowledge graphs to predict if a link is shared between drug and a protein or gene.
By establishing this link, one can infer that a drug will be able to target the particular protein of interest.
