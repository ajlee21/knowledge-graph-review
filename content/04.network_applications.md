## Applying Knowledge Graphs to Biomedical Challenges

1. Mention that these graphs can be used for discovery
2. Mention representation learning (aka representing a graph as dense vectors for nodes and/or edges)
3. 

### Unifying Techniques

Mapping high dimensional data into a low dimensional space has greatly improved modeling performance in fields such as natural language processing [@arxiv:1301.3781; @arxiv:1310.4546] and image analysis [@arxiv:1512.03385].
The success of these approaches provides rationale for projecting knowledge graphs into a low dimensional space as well [@arxiv:1709.05584].
Techniques that perform this projection often require information on how nodes are connected with one another [@raw:gongreplearn; @doi:10.1109/TKDE.2016.2606098; @raw:hanreplearn; @doi:10.1145/2806416.2806512], while other approaches can work directly with the edges themselves [@arxiv:1610.04073].
We group methods for producing low-dimensional representations of knowledge graphs into the following three categories: matrix factorization, translational methods, and deep learning.

#### Matrix Factorization

1. Mention techniques for these with some papers

#### Deep Learning

1. Define node neighborhoods
2. Talk about random walks 
3. Talk about auto encoders random walk independent approaches 

### Unifying Applications

Knowledge graphs have been used in many biomedical applications ranging from identifying protein functions [@doi:10.1186/s12859-018-2163-9] to prioritizing cancer genes [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty148] to recommending safer drugs to patients [@arxiv:1710.05980; @doi:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33011126].
In this section we discuss how knowledge graphs are being applied in biomedical settings. 
We put particular emphasis on an emerging set of techniques: those that project knowledge graphs into a low dimensional space.

#### Disease and Gene Interactions

1. Mention disease gene prioritization
2. Mention Disease gene associations

#### Protein Protein Interactions

1. Mention predicting genes interacting genes

#### Drug Interactions

1. Talk about drug side effects
2. Drug repurposing
3. Drug-Disease Interations

#### Clinical applications

1. Can mention EHR use and other related applications
2. Mention Tiffany's work on private data embeddings
