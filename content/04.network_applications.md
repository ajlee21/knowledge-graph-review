## Applying Knowledge Graphs to Biomedical Challenges

1. Mention that these graphs can be used for discovery
2. Mention representation learning (aka representing a graph as dense vectors for nodes and/or edges)
3. 

### Unifying Techniques

1. Set up the problem that maps a knowledge graph into a low dimensional space

#### Matrix Factorization

1. Mention techniques for these with some papers

#### Translational Distance Models

Translational distance methods view edges in a network as linear transformations.
Every node-edge pair is consisdered a triplet with head nodes represented as $\textbf{h}$, edges represented as $\textbf{r}$, and tail nodes represented as $\textbf{t}$.
These representations are combined into the following equation: $\textbf{h} + \textbf{r} \approx \textbf{t}$ [@raw:bordestranse].
Embeddings for $\textbf{h}$, $\textbf{r}$, $\textbf{t}$ are optimized while satisfying the above equation.
In this section we briefly discusss approaches that take this viewpoint to map networks into a low dimemsional space.

The originating work for this idea was TransE [@raw:bordestranse].
TransE uses every edge in a network and optimizes h, r, and t embeddings, while preserving the gloabl equation ($\textbf{h} + \textbf{r} \approx \textbf{t}$).
Using this method TransE was able to generate useful embeddings.
A caveat to this approach is that it the training steps force relationships to have a one to one mapping.
This may not be appropiate for all types of relationships.
A number of studies have worked on resolving this issue [@raw:wangtransH; @raw:lintransR, @arxiv:1610.04073; @arxiv:1909.00672]. 
Overall these methods take in interesting perspective in regards to generating network embeddings.
Possible future direction for these models is to include heterogenous type of information such as confidence scores of an edge, the type of edge itself or even textual information.
