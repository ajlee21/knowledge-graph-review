#### Clinical applications

Applications in the clinical field consist of aiding clinicians to make accurate diagnoses [@doi:10.1109/TKDE.2016.2605687], predict mortality risk scores [@doi:10.1145/2623330.2623742] or improve prescribed treatments [@arxiv:1710.05980].
These applications use de-identified electronic health records to obtain information about patient diagnoses via billing codes (e.g. ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkr972]) and drug treatments prescribed by clinicians.
This information can be combined into a unified resource like a knowledge graph [@pmid:26306276; @doi:10.1145/2110363.2110415; @arxiv:1707.05340; @doi:10.1186/s12859-015-0549-5].
Once the knowledge graph is formed methods can then utilize this high dimensional resource various clinical applications. 
We discuss efforts that involve constructing knowledge graphs and then using them for clinical tasks.

Zhao et al [@arxiv:1709.0690]. created multiple bipartite networks from EHR data.
These networks contained information on diseases, symptoms, medical testing results and patient diagnoses.
After constructing these networks, Zhao et al. used markov random fields on the network to make clinical decisions such as medical test recommendations and drug recommendations [@arxiv:1709.0690].
Bipartite networks can only contain two distinct data types, which means these networks are missing information.
Other approaches used bipartite networks to make safer drug recommendations [@arxiv:1710.05980; @doi:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33011126].
Besides drug recommendations, other methods used network embeddings to predict patient diagnoses [@arxiv:1611.07012] and make risk assessment [@doi:10.1145/2783258.2783352]
 
Overall, approaches that use these networks are quite limited.
Mentioned above networks only contain one to three different data types, which can lean to missing potentially useful information such as disease resemblance, individual drug side effects, anatomy where diseases progress in and patient genetic information.
Future approaches should consider increasing their networks to include other data types.
Furthermore, approaches have mentioned that EHR contains erroneous or missing information [@arxiv:1611.07012; @arxiv:1710.05980; @doi:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33011126].
This can hinder power of these approaches and future direction should continue working on fixing this missing data problem.
Another direction to consider is using noise aware models that can take erroneous information into account.
