Using knowledge graphs for clinical applications is in early stages of development and approaches in this context use knowledge graphs to aid doctors in improving patent healthcare.
Typically these graphs are constructed from electronic health records (EHR) where nodes represent patients, drugs and diseases and edges represent relationships such as a patient being perscribed a treatment or a patient being diagnosed with a disease [@pmid:26306276; @doi:10.1145/2110363.2110415; @arxiv:1707.05340; @doi:10.1186/s12859-015-0549-5].
Once constructed, these graphs are utilized to perform tasks such as improving patient diagnoses [@doi:10.1109/TKDE.2016.2605687;@arxiv:1709.06908] or recommending safer drugs for patients [@arxiv:1710.05980; @arxiv:1709.06908].

Early work in this field used translational models (Figure {@fig:unifying_techniques_overview} (b)) on medical knowledge graphs to make safe drug recommendations.
Wang et al. [@arxiv:1710.05980] used a variant of the TransH [@raw:wangtransH] model to create a recommendation system for drug patient recommendations.
The researchers constructed a disease-patient-drug network by integrating a patient-disease bipartite network with a patient drug bipartite network.
Every node in the graph was embedded while satisfying the equation: $\textbf{h} - r \approx \textbf{t}$.
Following the embedding step, the researchers formulated their own similarity metric to recommend drug combinations to patients that have low number of interactions [@arxiv:1710.05980].
Researchers in [@arxiv:1909.00672] had a similar variant of the TransH model on a medical knowledge graph, but they evaluated their model link prediction rather than patient recommendation.
A limitation for both works is data availability.

Deep learning techniques in this field have skipped over the common node2vec and autoencoder models and started to use graph attention models [@arxiv:1706.03762].
These models mimic the popular machine translation models [@arxiv:1409.0473] and simultaneously embed knowledge graphs into a low dimensional space while performing the task at hand.
Choi et al. [@arxiv:1611.07012] used a graph attention model to make patient diagnosis predictions.
The authors constructed a directed graph using medical concepts from patient EHR data.
This directed graph was fed into a graph attention network and then used to predict a patient's likelihood of heart failure [@arxiv:1611.07012].
Other approaches have begun to adapt these graph attention models to make safe drug recommendations [@doi:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33011126] and patient diagnosis [@arxiv:1906.04716].
Overall these methods are limited by the cleanliness of the data.

Knowledge graphs have shown promising results when used for clinical applications; however, work in this field still has room for improvement.
Majority of approaches have run into probelms with EHR data as multitude of datasets contain erroneous or missing information [@arxiv:1611.07012; @arxiv:1710.05980; @doi:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33011126].
Future directions include filling in this gap to improve knowledge graph dection power or building noise aware models that can take erroneous information into account.
