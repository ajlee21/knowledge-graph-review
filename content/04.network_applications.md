Using knowledge graphs for clinical applications is in early stages of development, but the long-term goal is to use analyses of knowledge graphs to aid patient care.
Typically, graphs for these applications are constructed from electronic health records (EHR) and nodes represent patients, drugs and diseases and edges represent relationships such as a patient being prescribed a treatment or a patient being diagnosed with a disease [@pmid:26306276; @doi:10.1145/2110363.2110415; @arxiv:1707.05340; @doi:10.1186/s12859-015-0549-5].
Tasks range from improving patient diagnoses [@doi:10.1109/TKDE.2016.2605687;@arxiv:1709.06908] to recommending safer drugs for patients [@arxiv:1710.05980; @arxiv:1709.06908].

Early work in this field applied translational models (Figure {@fig:unifying_techniques_overview} (b)) to knowledge graphs to recommend safe drugs.
Wang et al. [@arxiv:1710.05980] used a variant of the TransH [@raw:wangtransH] model to create such a system for patients.
They constructed a disease-patient-drug network by integrating a patient-disease bipartite network with a patient-drug bipartite network.
Every node in the graph was embedded while satisfying the following equation: $\textbf{h} - r \approx \textbf{t}$.
Following the embedding step, the authors formulated their own similarity metric that selected drug combinations with a low number of interactions [@arxiv:1710.05980].
Researchers in [@arxiv:1909.00672] applied a similar variant of the TransH model to a medical knowledge graph and evaluated their model for link prediction rather than patient recommendation.

In contrast with other applications where node2vec and auto-encoder models have become established, deep learning methods in this area often use graph attention models [@arxiv:1706.03762].
These models mimic machine translation models [@arxiv:1409.0473] and aim to simultaneously embed knowledge graphs into a low dimensional space and perform the task at hand.
Choi et al. [@arxiv:1611.07012] used a graph attention model to predict patient diagnoses.
The authors constructed a directed graph using medical concepts from patient EHR data.
This directed graph was fed into a graph attention network and then used to predict a patient's likelihood of heart failure [@arxiv:1611.07012].
Other approaches have used graph attention models to perform clinical tasks such as drug safety recommendations [@doi:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33011126] and patient diagnoses [@arxiv:1906.04716].

Knowledge graphs have shown promising results when used for clinical applications; however, there is still room for improvement.
Most approaches have run into the common problem with missing data from EHR [@arxiv:1611.07012; @arxiv:1710.05980; @doi:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33011126].
Future directions consist of designing algorithms that can fill in this missing data gap or construct models that can take missing data into account.
