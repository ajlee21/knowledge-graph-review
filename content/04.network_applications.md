## Applying Knowledge Graphs to Biomedical Challenges

1. Mention that these graphs can be used for discovery
2. Mention representation learning (aka representing a graph as dense vectors for nodes and/or edges)
3. 

### Unifying Techniques

1. Set up the problem that maps a knowledge graph into a low dimensional space

#### Matrix Factorization

1. Mention techniques for these with some papers

#### Deep Learning

1. Define node neighborhoods
2. Talk about random walks 
3. Talk about auto encoders random walk independent approaches 

### Unifying Applications

1. Mention how the previous section is used in a biomedical setting

#### Disease-Gene Applications

Knowledge graphs are used to identify sets of genes relavant to disease.
These identified genes can lead to generating future hypotheses about the underlying disease.
For example authors used network embeddings to priortize genes in X.
<font color=red> Dicuss some approaches that used gene priroitization. Break it down by the type of network used and mention that the approaches involved embeddings. </font>
