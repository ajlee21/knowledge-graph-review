## Applying Knowledge Graphs to Biomedical Challenges

1. Mention that these graphs can be used for discovery
2. Mention representation learning (aka representing a graph as dense vectors for nodes and/or edges)
3. 

### Unifying Techniques

1. Set up the problem that maps a knowledge graph into a low dimensional space

#### Matrix Factorization

1. Mention techniques for these with some papers

#### Deep Learning

1. Define node neighborhoods
2. Talk about random walks 
3. Talk about auto encoders random walk independent approaches 

### Unifying Applications

Knowledge graphs have been used in many biomedical applications ranging from identifying protein functions [@doi:10.1186/s12859-018-2163-9] to prioritizing cancer genes [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty148] to recommending safer drugs to patients [@arxiv:1710.05980; @doi:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33011126].
In this section we discuss how knowledge graphs are being applied in biomedical settings. 
We put particular emphasis on an emerging set of techniques: those that project knowledge graphs into a low dimensional space.

#### Disease and Gene Interactions

1. Mention disease gene prioritization
2. Mention Disease gene associations

#### Protein Protein Interactions

1. Mention predicting genes interacting genes

#### Drug Interactions

1. Talk about drug side effects
2. Drug repurposing
3. Drug-Disease Interations

#### Clinical applications

1. Can mention EHR use and other related applications
2. Mention Tiffany's work on private data embeddings
