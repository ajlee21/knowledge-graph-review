Using knowledge graphs for clinical applications is in early stages of development and these graphs are used to improve patent healthcare.
Typically, these graphs are constructed from electronic health records (EHR) where nodes represent patients, drugs and diseases and edges represent relationships such as a patient being perscribed a treatment or a patient being diagnosed with a disease [@pmid:26306276; @doi:10.1145/2110363.2110415; @arxiv:1707.05340; @doi:10.1186/s12859-015-0549-5].
Tasks in this context range from improving patient diagnoses [@doi:10.1109/TKDE.2016.2605687;@arxiv:1709.06908] to recommending safer drugs for patients [@arxiv:1710.05980; @arxiv:1709.06908].
We discuss approaches that project knowledge graphs into a low dimensional space to make clinical predictions.

Early work in this field used translational models (Figure {@fig:unifying_techniques_overview} (b)) on knowledge graphs to make safe drug recommendations.
Wang et al. [@arxiv:1710.05980] used a variant of the TransH [@raw:wangtransH] model to create a recommendation system for to recmmend safe drugs to patients.
The authors constructed a disease-patient-drug network by integrating a patient-disease bipartite network with a patient-drug bipartite network.
Every node in the graph was embedded while satisfying the following equation: $\textbf{h} - r \approx \textbf{t}$.
Following the embedding step, the authors formulated their own similarity metric that selected drug combinations with a low number of interactions [@arxiv:1710.05980].
Researchers in [@arxiv:1909.00672] had a similar variant of the TransH model on a medical knowledge graph, but they evaluated their model link prediction rather than patient recommendation.
A limitation for both methods is that the ehr records are missing data for patients, which results in networks missing information as well.

Deep learning techniques in this field have skipped over the node2vec and autoencoder models and started to use graph attention models [@arxiv:1706.03762].
These models mimic the popular machine translation models [@arxiv:1409.0473] and are able to simultaneously embed knowledge graphs into a low dimensional space and perform the task at hand.
Choi et al. [@arxiv:1611.07012] used a graph attention model to make patient diagnosis predictions.
The authors constructed a directed graph using medical concepts from patient EHR data.
This directed graph was fed into a graph attention network and then used to predict a patient's likelihood of heart failure [@arxiv:1611.07012].
Other approaches have begun to adapt these graph attention models to perorm clinical tasks such as drug safety recommendations [@doi:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33011126] and patient diagnoses [@arxiv:1906.04716].
Similar to the transH approaches these methods are limited by missing data in the EHR records.

Knowledge graphs have shown promising results when used for clinical applications; however, there is still room for improvement.
Majority of approaches have run into the common problem with missing data from EHR [@arxiv:1611.07012; @arxiv:1710.05980; @doi:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33011126].
Future directions include designing algorithms that can fill in the missing data gap and construct models that can take missing data into account.
