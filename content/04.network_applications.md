## Applying Knowledge Graphs to Biomedical Challenges

1. Mention that these graphs can be used for discovery
2. Mention representation learning (aka representing a graph as dense vectors for nodes and/or edges)
3. 

### Unifying Techniques

Knowledge graphs contain data in a high dimensional space and this space makes using knowledge graphs an intricate problem.
Due to success of mapping high dimensional data (i.e. words) into a low dimensional space [@arxiv:1301.3781, @arxiv:1310.4546], the field has turned to mapping networks into a low dimensional space [@arxiv:1709.05584].
Some methods work solely on edges within a graph [@arxiv:1610.04073], while other methods require a definition of a node's neighborhood [@arxiv:1607.00653; @doi:10.1109/TKDE.2016.2606098].
This neighborhood is defined as a set of nodes that are adjacent to the central node.
This set of nodes can be obtained through the use of an adjancency matrix [@raw:gongreplearn;@doi:10.1109/TKDE.2016.2606098;@raw:hanreplearn;@doi:10.1145/2806416.2806512]; however there are other ways to obtain this set (i.e. random walks).
Once the neighborhood is defined, every node in the network can then be projected into a low dimensional space.
We group approaches use representation learning on networks into three categories: matrix factorization, translational methods, and deep learning.
Extra insight on these approaches can be found in [10.1109/TKDE.2017.2754499] and [10.1109/TKDE.2018.2807452].
