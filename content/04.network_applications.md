## Applying Knowledge Graphs to Biomedical Challenges

1. Mention that these graphs can be used for discovery
2. Mention representation learning (aka representing a graph as dense vectors for nodes and/or edges)
3. 

### Unifying Techniques

Methods that project a network into a low dimensional space involve obtaining information about a node's neighborhood.
This neighborhood is defined as a set of nodes that are adjacent to a central node.
Ususally an adjancency matrix is used to represent these neighborhoods, but for large networks this method becomes infeasible.
Other methods use alternative ways (e.g. random walks) to represent these neighborhoods.
Once these neighborhoods are defined, each node is then projected into the low dimensional space.
Approaches that do this projection fall into three categories: matrix factorization, translational methods, and deep learning.
We discuss selected methods for these categores and refer to [10.1109/TKDE.2017.2754499] and [10.1109/TKDE.2018.2807452] for extra insight on these approaches.
