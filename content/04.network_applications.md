## Applying Knowledge Graphs to Biomedical Challenges

1. Mention that these graphs can be used for discovery
2. Mention representation learning (aka representing a graph as dense vectors for nodes and/or edges)
3. 

### Unifying Techniques

1. Set up the problem that maps a knowledge graph into a low dimensional space

#### Matrix Factorization

1. Mention techniques for these with some papers

#### Translational Distance Models

Translational distance methods view edges in a network as linear transformations.
Every node-edge pair is consisdered a triplet with an edge represented as $\textbf{r}$, a beginning node represented as $\textbf{h}$ and an end node represented as $\textbf{t}$.
These representations are shown as vectors where an edge follows the following equation: $\textbf{h} + \textbf{r} \approx \textbf{t}$.
Approaches using this view point construct embedings that satisfy the above equation.

Ground breaking work that used this view point was TransE [@raw:bordestranse].
This method used the above idea to generate dense vectors for network nodes.
Using a loss function optimized to preserve the above equtaion, the authors achieved comparable embeddings.
Problem with this approach is that the mapping process needs to be one to one.
To fix this flaw, many approaches have built upon one another to make more robust projections [@raw:wangtransH; @raw:lintransR, @arxiv:1610.04073; @arxiv:1909.00672].
