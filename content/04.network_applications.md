## Applying Knowledge Graphs to Biomedical Challenges

1. Mention that these graphs can be used for discovery
2. Mention representation learning (aka representing a graph as dense vectors for nodes and/or edges)
3. 

### Unifying Techniques

Mapping high dimensional data into a low dimensional space improves modeling performance in fields such as Natural Language Processing [@arxiv:1301.3781; @arxiv:1310.4546] and Image Analysis [@arxiv:1512.03385].
The success of this process provides rationale for projecting a knowledge graph into a low dimensional space [@arxiv:1709.05584].
Techniques that perform this projection often require information on how nodes are connected with one another [@raw:gongreplearn; @doi:10.1109/TKDE.2016.2606098; @raw:hanreplearn; @doi:10.1145/2806416.2806512], while other approaches can work directly with the edges themselves [@arxiv:1610.04073].
We group the above methods into the following three categories: matrix factorization, translational methods, and deep learning.
The rest of this section will discuss the pros and cons within each method category.

#### Matrix Factorization
