Deep learning is a paradigm that uses multiple non-linear transformations to map high dimensional data into a low dimensional space.
Many techniques that use deep learning for knowledge graphs are based on word2vec [@arxiv:1310.4546; @arxiv:1301.3781], a set of approaches that are widely used for natural language processing.
The goal of word2vec is to project words into a low dimensional space that preserves their semantic meaning.
Strategies for training word2vec models use one of two neural network architectures: skip-gram and continuous bag of words (CBOW).
Both models are feed-forward neural networks, but CBOW models are trained to predict a word given it's context while skip-gram models are trained to predict the context given a word [@arxiv:1310.4546; @arxiv:1301.3781].
Once training has finished, words are now associated with dense vectors that downstream models, such as feed forward networks or recurrent networks, can use for input.

Deepwalk [@arxiv:1403.6652] is an early method designed to project a knowledge graph into a low dimensional space. 
The first step of this method is to perform a random walk along a knowledge graph.
During the random walk, every generated sequence of nodes is recorded and treated like a sentence in word2vec [@arxiv:1310.4546; @arxiv:1301.3781].
After every node has been processed, a skip-gram model is trained to predict the context of each node thereby projecting a knowledge graph into a low dimensional space [@arxiv:1403.6652].
A limitation of this method is that the random walk cannot be controlled, so every node has an equal chance to be reached.
Grover and Leskovec [@arxiv:1607.00653] demonstrated that this limitation can hurt performance when classifying edges between nodes and developed node2vec as a result.
Node2vec [@arxiv:1607.00653] operates the in the same fashion as deepwalk; however, this algorithm specifies a parameter that lets the random walk be biased when traversing nodes.
A caveat to both deepwalk and node2vec is that both algorithms ignore information such as edge type and node type.
Various approaches have evolved to fix this limitation by incorporating  node, edge and even path types when projecting nodes into a low dimensional space [@arxiv:1704.03165; @doi:10.1145/3097983.3098036; @arxiv:1809.02269; @arxiv:1808.05611].
These approaches primarily capture a network's local structure. 
An emerging area of work is to develop approaches that capture both the local and global structure of a network when projecting knowledge graphs into a low dimensional space.

Some deep learning approaches use an adjacency matrix as input [@arxiv:1310.4546; @arxiv:1301.3781] instead of using the word2vec framing.
Algorithms such as auto-encoders can also generate network embeddings [@arxiv:1802.08352; @arxiv:1611.07308; @arxiv:1802.04407].
Autoencoders [@arxiv:1404.7828; @raw:Baldi2011] are neural networks that map input such as an adjacency matrices into a low dimensional space and then learns how to construct this space by reconstructing the same input.
The generated low dimensional space captures the node connectivity structure of the knowledge graph and every node is mapped onto this space [@arxiv:1802.08352; @arxiv:1611.07308; @arxiv:1802.04407].
Despite the high potential of this approach, this method relies on an adjacency matrix for input.
If a knowledge graph asymptotically increases in size, these approaches could run into scalability issues as discovered by Khosla et al. [@arxiv:1903.07902].
Plus, Khosla et al.[@arxiv:1903.07902] discovered that approaches akin to node2vec outperformed algorithms using autoencoders when undergoing link prediction and node classification.
Overall, the performance of these models largely depends upon the structure of nodes and edges within a knowledge graph [@arxiv:1903.07902].
Future approaches should consider creating hybrid models that use both node2vec and autoencoders to construct complementary low dimensional representations of knowledge graphs.
