## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Knowledge graphs are a practical resource for many biomedical applications.
These graphs represent biomedical concepts and relationships in the form of nodes and edges.
These graphs are constructed from pre-existing databases that are populated by experts via manual, automatic and semi-automatic processes.
Once constructed, these graphs have been used to solve biomedical problems within the multi-omics, pharmaceutical, and clinical domains.
The inital step to use a knowledge graph is to represent these graphs in a low dimensional space, which is formally known as representation learning.
This space preserves a knowledge graphâ€™s local and/or global structure and can support efforts to apply machine learning methods to make predictions.
In this review we highlight the practicality of knowledge graphs within the biomedical domain.
We first discuss different ways to construct a knowledge graph and highlight future directions for the mentioned approaches.
Next, we discuss the pros and cons of techniques that represent knowledge graphs in a low dimensional space.
Finally, we talk about applications that use knowledge graphs to perform biomedical tasks and propose future directions for these applications.
