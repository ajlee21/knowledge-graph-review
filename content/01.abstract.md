## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Knowledge graphs are a practical resource for many biomedical applications.
These graphs represent biomedical concepts and relationships in the form of nodes and edges.
These graphs are constructed from pre-existing databases that are populated by experts via manual curation and automatic systems.
Following construction, these graphs are represented in a low dimensional space via representation learning.
This space preserves a knowledge graphâ€™s local and/or global structure and can support efforts to apply machine learning methods to make predictions within the multi-omics, pharmaceutical, and clinical domains.
In this review we highlight the practicality of knowledge graphs within the biomedical realm.
We first discuss different ways to construct a knowledge graph and provide future adive to improve these processes.
Next, we discuss the pros and cons of representation learning techniques that project knowledge graphs onto a low dimensional space.
Finally, we talk about applications that use knowledge graphs to perform biomedical tasks and propose future opportunities for these applications.
