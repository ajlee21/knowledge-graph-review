## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Knowledge graphs can support many biomedical applications.
These graphs represent biomedical concepts and relationships in the form of nodes and edges.
In this review we discuss how these graphs are constructed and applied with a particular focus on the ways machine learning approaches are changing these processes.
In many examples in the literature, biomedical knowledge graphs have been constructed from pre-existing databases that are populated by experts via manual curation, but we are now also seeing a more robust use of automatic systems.
A number of techniques are used to represent knowledge graphs, but often machine learning methods are used to learn a low-dimensional representation that can support many different applications.
This representation is designed to preserve a knowledge graphâ€™s local and/or global structure.
Additional machine learning methods can be applied to this representation to make predictions within genomic, pharmaceutical, and clinical domains.
We frame our discussion first around knowledge graph construction then around unifying techniques and unifying applications separately.
Advances in machine learning for biomedicine are creating new opportunities across many domains, and we note potential avenues for future work with knowledge graphs that appear particularly fruitful.
