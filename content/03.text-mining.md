## Text Mining for Relationship Extraction

1. Set up the context for relationship extraction
	1. Define the problem
	2. Talk about the importance of the problem (filling knowledge bases -> point researchers to relevant papers)
2. Give overview towards taxonomy of approaches (hand written rules, unsupervised machine learning, supervised machine learning etc.)

### Hand written Natural Language Processing Techniques

1. Mention papers on hand written rules and expressions

### Unsupervised Machine Learning

1. Mention Clustering Analysis
2. Mention Co-Occurrence approaches

### Supervised Machine Learning

1. Mention the availablility of publically available data
	1. PPI - 5 datasets 
	   1. 10.1016/j.artmed.2004.07.016 
	   2. 10.1186/1471-2105-8-50 
	   3. Learning language in logic - genic interaction extraction challenge
	   4. 10.1093/bioinformatics/btl616 
	   5. http://helix-web.stanford.edu/psb02/ding.pdf
	2. DaG - 3 datasets
	   1. 10.1016/j.jbi.2012.04.004

	3. CiD 
	  1. 10.1093/database/baw068 
	4. CbG 
	  1. Biocreative VI track 5 - raw citation
	5. more if exists talk about deep learning methods
2. Mention the use of Support Vector Machines and other non deep learning classifiers
   1. Will have to mention that field has moved to deep learning.
   2. 10.1186/s13326-017-0168-3
   3. 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004630
3. Mention deep learning methods
   1. 1901.06103v1
   2. 10.1016/j.knosys.2018.11.020
   3. 10.1177/0165551516673485
   4. 1706.01556v2
   5. ^^ A few papers here but a lot more will be put into place 
   6. Mention caveat which is the need for large annotated datasets
   7. Mention a direction the field is moving to which is weak supervision and more that info that will come in time.
