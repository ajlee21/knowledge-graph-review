### Text Mining for Relationship Extraction

#### Rule-Based Relationship Extraction

Rule-based extraction consists of identifying sentences that contain important keywords or grammatical patterns that allude to relationships of interest. 
Keywords are established via expert knowledge or though the use of pre-existing ontologies.
Grammatical patterns are constructed via experts curating parse trees, which are tree data structures that depict a sentence's grammatical structure.
Parse trees come into two forms a constituency parse tree and a dependency parse trees.
Both trees use part of speech tags, labels that dictate the grammatical role of a word such as noun, verb, adjective, etc, for construction.
A constituency parse trees breaks a sentence down into a subphrases (Figure {@fig:constituency-parse-tree-example}) while dependency path trees analyzes the grammatical structure of a sentence (Figure {@fig:dependency-parse-tree-example}).
Many text mining approaches [@doi:10.1093/database/bay108; @doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw503; @doi:10.1186/s13326-017-0168-3] use such trees to generate features for machine learning algorithms.
These approaches are discussed in later sections.
For this section we focus on approaches that mainly use rule based extraction to detect sentences that assert a relationship.

Grammatical patterns can simplify sentences for easy extraction [@pmid:21346999; @pmid:24850848].
Jonnalagadda et al. used a set of grammar rules inspired by constituency trees to reshape complex sentences with simpler versions [@pmid:21346999].
These simplified versions were manually curated to determine the presence of a relationship.
By simplyfing sentences this approach achieved high recall, but had low precision [@pmid:21346999].
Other approach used simplification techniques to make extraction easier [@doi:10.1093/database/baw156; @doi:10.1186/1471-2105-15-285; @doi:10.1093/database/bav020; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004391].
Tudor et al., simplified sentences to detect protein phosphorylation events [@doi:10.1093/database/bav020].
The sentence simplifier broke complex sentences that contain multiple protein events into smaller sentences that contain only one distinct event.
By breaking these sentences down the authors were able to increase their recall.
However, sentences that contained ambigious directionality or multiple phosphroylation events were too complex for the simplifier.
As a consequence the simplifier produced errors in recall [@doi:10.1093/database/bav020].
These errors highlight a crucial need for future algorithms to be generalizable enough to handle various forms of complex sentences.

Pattern matching is a fundamental approach used to detect relationship asserting sentences.
In this context patterns can consist of phrases from constituency trees, a set of keywords or some combination of both to detect sentences [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkx462; @doi:10.1186/s12859-018-2103-8; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0152725; @doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btg449; @doi:10.1186/1471-2105-14-181; @doi:10.1109/TCBB.2014.2372765].
Xu et al. designed a pattern matcher system to detect sentences in PubMed abstracts that indicate drug-disease treatments [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-14-181].
This system matched drug-disease pairs from clinicaltrails.gov to drug-disease pairs mentioned in abstracts.
This matching process aided the authors in identifying sentences that were used to create simple patterns, such as "Drug in the treatment of Disease" [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-14-181], to match sentences in a wide variety of abstracts.
The authors hand curated two datasets for evalution and achieved a high precision score of 0.904 and a low recall score of 0.131 [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-14-181].
This low recall score was based on constructed patterns being very specific to top occurring drug paris.
This flaw resulted in rarely occurring pairs having a high likelihood of being missed.
Following approaches using constituency trees, some approaches used dependency trees to construct patterns [@doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2015.08.008; @doi:10.1093/database/bay108].
Depending upon the nature of the algorithm, dependency trees could be more appropiate than constituency trees and vise versa.
The performance difference between the two approaches still remains as an open question for future exploration.

Rules based methods provide a basis for many relationship extraction systems.
Approaches in this category range from simplifing sentences for easy extraction to identifing sentences based on matched key phrases or grammatical patterns.
Both require a significant amount of manual effort and expert knowledge to perform well.
A future direction is to develop ways to automatically construct these hand-crafted patterns, which would accelerate the process of creating new  rule-based systems.

A visualization of a dependency parse tree using the following sentence as in example: "BRCA1 is associated with breast cancer" [@raw:honnibal2017spacy].
For these type of trees the root begins at the main verb of a sentence.
Each arrows depicts the dependency shared between two words.
For example, the dependency between BRCA1 and associated is nsubjpass, which stands for passive nominal subject.
This means that BRCA1 is the subject of the sentneces and it is being referred to by the word associated.

A visualization of a constituency parse tree using the following sentence: "BRCA1 is associated with breast cancer" [@raw:eisenbach2006phpsyntaxtree].
This type of tree has the root beginning at the start of the sentence.
Each word is grouped into subphrases depending on the part of speech tags of a word.
For example, the word "associated" is a past particple verb (VBN) that belongs to the verb phrase (VP) subgroup.
