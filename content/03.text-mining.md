## Building Biomedical Knowledge Graphs

1. Set up the context for relationship extraction
	1. Define the problem
	2. Talk about the importance of the problem (filling knowledge bases -> point researchers to relevant papers)
2. Give overview towards taxonomy of approaches (hand written rules, unsupervised machine learning, supervised machine learning etc.)

### Constructing Databases and Manual Curation

1. Talk about papers that construct knowledge graphs without text mining approaches
2. Discuss the positives and negatives for these methods

### Text Mining for Relationship Extraction

#### Rule-Based Natural Language Processing

Rule based extraction relies on expert knowledge to identify keywords or grammar patterns to detect relevant sentences.

7. 10.1186/1471-2105-14-181 - CtD extraction

Pros - rule based extraction can be used to generate new features for machine learning approaches
Decent precision for these approaches

#### Unsupervised Machine Learning

1. Mention Clustering Analysis
2. Mention Co-Occurrence approaches

#### Supervised Machine Learning

   5. ^^ A few papers here but a lot more will be put into place 
   6. Mention caveat which is the need for large annotated datasets
   7. Mention a direction the field is moving to which is weak supervision and more that info that will come in time.
