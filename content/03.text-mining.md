## Building Biomedical Knowledge Graphs

1. Set up the context for relationship extraction
	1. Define the problem
	2. Talk about the importance of the problem (filling knowledge bases -> point researchers to relevant papers)
2. Give overview towards taxonomy of approaches (hand written rules, unsupervised machine learning, supervised machine learning etc.)

### Constructing Databases and Manual Curation

1. Talk about papers that construct knowledge graphs without text mining approaches
2. Discuss the positives and negatives for these methods

### Text Mining for Relationship Extraction

#### Rule-Based Natural Language Processing

1. Mention papers on hand written rules and expressions

#### Unsupervised Machine Learning

1. Mention Clustering Analysis
2. Mention Co-Occurrence approaches
