## Building Biomedical Knowledge Graphs

1. Set up the context for relationship extraction
	1. Define the problem
	2. Talk about the importance of the problem (filling knowledge bases -> point researchers to relevant papers)
2. Give overview towards taxonomy of approaches (hand written rules, unsupervised machine learning, supervised machine learning etc.)

### Constructing Databases and Manual Curation

Manual curation is a process that involves domain experts reading papers and identifying sentences that assert a relationship.
This approach provides relatively accurate results [@doi:10.1038/nmeth1209-860; @doi:10.1038/nmeth.1284; @doi:10.1093/database/bau058], but comes with a significant amount of limitations [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btm229].
Besides curation, experts have used automated approaches to populate databases [@doi:10.1093/database/bas020].



1. Talk about papers that construct knowledge graphs without text mining approaches
2. Discuss the positives and negatives for these methods

### Text Mining for Relationship Extraction

#### Rule-Based Natural Language Processing

1. Mention papers on hand written rules and expressions

#### Unsupervised Machine Learning

1. Mention Clustering Analysis
2. Mention Co-Occurrence approaches

#### Supervised Machine Learning

   5. ^^ A few papers here but a lot more will be put into place 
   6. Mention caveat which is the need for large annotated datasets
   7. Mention a direction the field is moving to which is weak supervision and more that info that will come in time.
