## Conclusion

Knowledge graphs have been shown to be a useful resource for the biomeidcal domain.
These graphs have been constructed by experts via manual, automatic and semi-automatic pipelines that extract relationships from text.
Manual approaches provide relatively precise results, but have difficulty scaling with an increasing publication rate.
Automatic approaches have attempted to speed up relationship extraction efforts, but these approaches can generate noisy results.
An extension to these efforts is to utilize semi-automatic approaches that combines the speed of automatic approaches with the percision of manual approaches.

Before these graphs are utilized to perform biomedical tasks, they are represented in a low dimensional space.
This space captures the structure of the graph and is exploited by machine learning algorithms to make predictions.
Methods that perform this projects consist of using linear methods such as matrix factorization and translational modeling to deep learning techniques.
Most of these methods do not take graph features such as node type and edge type into account, which is a direction future processes can take. 

Lastly, knowledge graphs have been utilized to solve biomedical problems within the multi-omics, pharmaceutical, and clinical domains.
Tasks in these domains consist of predicting protein information to predicting new treatments for previously established drugs to diagonising patients with a disease.
Many of these applications use deep learning techniques to perform representation learning on these graphs and these techniques is where the field is focusing on.
A possible direction for these techniques is to combine deep learning models with other linear methods to improve performance.
