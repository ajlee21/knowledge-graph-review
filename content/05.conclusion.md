## Conclusion

Knowledge graphs have been shown to be an advantageous resource for the biomedical domain.
These graphs are constructed by experts via manual curation and automatic systems designed to extract relationships from text.
Manual curation provides relatively precise results, but have difficulty scaling with an increasing publication rate.
Automatic systems have attempted to speed up relationship extraction efforts, but generating large well-annotated datasets for these approaches still remains an open challenge.
Furthermore, relationship extraction efforts could benefit from semi-automatic pipelines where automated systems would obtain sentences at an acceptable recall level, then experts would manually curate sentences as a way to fix or remove irrelevant results.

Before knowledge graphs are utilized for biomedical tasks, they are represented in a low dimensional space.
This space is designed to capture the structure of the graph and is exploited by machine learning algorithms to make predictions.
Methods that perform this projection range from using linear methods such as matrix factorization and translational modeling to deep learning techniques.
Most of these approaches do not take graph features such as node type and edge type into account, which is an open direction future techniques can take. 

Lastly, knowledge graphs have been used to solve biomedical problems within the multi-omics, pharmaceutical, and clinical domains.
Tasks in these domains consist of predicting protein information, predicting new treatments for previously established drugs and diagnosing patients with a disease.
Most approaches discovered that validating findings is a challenging task because majority of the data is missing.
This is apparent in the clinical domain where electronic health records have missing patient information [@arxiv:1611.07012; @arxiv:1710.05980; @doi:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33011126].
An area of exploration for this field is to develop models that can handle this missing data dilemma.
Overall, knowledge graphs have benefitted the biomedical domain and prospective efforts should consider using these resources for future endeavors.
