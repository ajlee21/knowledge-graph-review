## Conclusion

Knowledge graphs have demonstrated to be an advantageous resource for the biomedical domain.
These graphs are constructed from pre-existing databases populated by domain experts via manual curation along with automated systems that extract relationships from text.
Typically knowledge graphs are utilized by representing them in a low dimensional space that is designed to capture the local and/or global structure of the graph.
Once constructed, this space is exploited by machine learning algorithms to perform biomedical tasks within the multi-omics, pharmaceutical, and clinical domains.

As the field progresses validation has a crucial role in advancing subsequent efforts.
Prevsiouly mentioned, validation remains a non-trivial task because experiments in this context demand a significant amount of time [@doi:10.1093/jamia/ocy117; @doi:10.1155/2017/2498957].
An open area of exploration is to develop approaches that can accelerate validation while improving upon the frequent blinded literature search.
Plus, future methods will need to reassure that biases such as node degree bias doesn't cofound novel results [@raw:Zietz2020].

Following validation, we anticipate that future techniques will improve upon constructing low dimensional representations of knowledge graphs by incorporating data such as node and edge types.
Plus, we foresee that future endeavors will have better insight on dealing with factors that can skew the strucutre of knowledge graphs such as experimental biases or missing data.
Nevertheless, knowledge graphs are an advantageous resources that have benefitted the biomedical domain.
