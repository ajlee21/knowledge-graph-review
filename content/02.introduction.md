## Introduction

Knowledge graphs are a practical resource for many real world applications.
They have been used in social medial mining to classify nodes [@arxiv:1101.3291] or to create a recommendation system [@doi:10.1145/3184558.3186904].
This resource has been used to understand natural language via creating a question and answering system.
This kind of system interprets simple questions and uses relational information to provide answers [@arxiv:1404.4326; @doi:10.1145/3038912.3052675].
In a biomedical setting these graphs have been used to prioritize genes relevant to disease [@pmid:21121028; @doi:10.1101/651000; @doi:10.1109/CIBCB.2019.8791472; @doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty559], perform drug repurposing [@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726] and identify drug-target interactions [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002574].

Defining a knowledge graph is a difficult task because there are multiple conflicting definitions [@raw:KG_DEF].
We define a knowledge graph as the following: a resource that acquires and integrates single or multiple sources of information into an abstract representation and applies logical reasoning to generate new knowledge [@raw:KG_DEF].
Based on this definition resources like Hetionet [@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726] would be considered a knowledge graph.
Hetionet integrates multiple sources of information into the form of a graph (example shown in Figure {@fig:hetionet_schema}).
This graph was used to derive novel information concerning unique drug treatments [@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726].
We do not consider databases like Diseases [@doi:10.1016/j.ymeth.2014.11.020] and DrugBank [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkx1037] to be knowledge graphs.
These resources contain essential information, but do not implement a means to infer new information.

Knowledge graphs are often constructed from manually curated databases [@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726; 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002574; @doi:10.1038/s41467-017-00680-8; @doi:10.1186/s12859-016-1336-7;  @doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2011.11.017].
These sources provide previously established information that can be incorporated into a graph. 
Others have used natural language processing techniques to build knowledge graphs [@doi:10.1186/s12859-015-0549-5; @doi:10.1007/s10115-019-01351-4].
For example, text mining systems can extract sentences that indicate protein-protein interactions [@doi:10.1016/j.knosys.2018.11.020].
Once these sentences have been identified, they are incorporated as evidence for establishing edges in a knowledge graph.

In this review we describe various approaches for constructing and applying knowledge graphs in a biomedical setting.
We discuss the pros and cons of constructing a knowledge graph via manually curated  databases and via text mining systems.
We also compare assorted approaches for applying knowledge graphs to solve biomedical problems.
Lastly, we conclude on the practicality of knowledge graphs and point out future applications that have yet to be explored.

This undirected network depicts pharmacological and biomedical information.
The nodes (circles) represent entities and edges (lines) depict  relational information between two entities.
