## Introduction

Knowledge graphs are an essential resource for many real world applications.
This resource uses graph theory to represent knowledge in the form of a graph.
Entites are represeted as nodes and relationships between entities are represented as edges (example shown in Figure {@fig:hetionet_schema}).
These graphs are ususally constructed by using manually curated databases, but there are approaches that used text mining to construct a graph.

Knowledge graphs have been used for social media mining i.e. classifying new nodes [@arxiv:1101.3291] or constructing a recommendation system [@doi:10.1145/3184558.3186904].
These graphs have been used to design question and answering systems.
These systems interpret natural language and provde answers to questions [@arxiv:1404.4326; @doi:10.1145/3038912.3052675].
Furthermore, knowledge graphs have been used in biomedical applications such as drug repurposing [@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726] and disease gene prioritization [@pmid:21121028; @doi:10.1101/651000; @doi:10.1109/CIBCB.2019.8791472].
Despite knowledge graphs being used in a multitude of different settings, this review will mainly focus on a biomedical setting.
Specifically, we focus on challenges circulating on construction knowledge graphs and their active role in a biomedical setting.

A metagraph (schema) of the heterogeneous network used in the rephetio project [@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726].
This network depicts pharmacological and biomedical information.
The entities are represented as nodes (circles) and relationships between entities are represented as edges (lines between two nodes).
