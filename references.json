    "abstract": "When dealing with large graphs, such as those that arise in the context of\nonline social networks, a subset of nodes may be labeled. These labels can\nindicate demographic values, interest, beliefs or other characteristics of the\nnodes (users). A core problem is to use this information to extend the labeling\nso that all nodes are assigned a label (or labels). In this chapter, we survey\nclassification techniques that have been proposed for this problem. We consider\ntwo broad categories: methods based on iterative application of traditional\nclassifiers using graph information as features, and methods which propagate\nthe existing labels via random walks. We adopt a common perspective on these\nmethods to highlight the similarities between different approaches within and\nacross the two categories. We also describe some extensions and related\ndirections to the central problem of node classification.",

    "abstract": "Building computers able to answer questions on any subject is a long standing\ngoal of artificial intelligence. Promising progress has recently been achieved\nby methods that learn to map questions to logical forms or database queries.\nSuch approaches can be effective but at the cost of either large amounts of\nhuman-labeled data or by defining lexicons and grammars tailored by\npractitioners. In this paper, we instead take the radical approach of learning\nto map questions to vectorial feature representations. By mapping answers into\nthe same space one can query any knowledge base independent of its schema,\nwithout requiring any grammar or lexicon. Our method is trained with a new\noptimization procedure combining stochastic gradient descent followed by a\nfine-tuning step using the weak supervision provided by blending automatically\nand collaboratively generated resources. We empirically demonstrate that our\nmodel can capture meaningful signals from its noisy supervision leading to\nmajor improvements over paralex, the only existing method able to be trained on\nsimilar weakly labeled data.",

Our method, called CoCoScore, scores the certainty of stating an association for each sentence that co-mentions two entities. CoCoScore is trained using distant supervision based on a gold-standard set of associations between entities of interest. Instead of requiring a manually annotated training corpus, co-mentions are labeled as positives/negatives according to their presence/absence in the gold standard. We show that CoCoScore outperforms previous approaches in identifying human disease–gene and tissue–gene associations as well as in identifying physical and functional protein–protein associations in different species. CoCoScore is a versatile text mining tool to uncover pairwise associations via co-occurrence mining, within and beyond biomedical applications.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>CoCoScore is available at: https://github.com/JungeAlexander/cocoscore.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Supplementary information</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Gene prioritization is an important step for this endeavor to make a short manageable list from a list of thousands of genes coming from high-throughput studies. Network propagation methods are promising and state of the art methods for gene prioritization based on the premise that functionally-related genes tend to be close to each other in the biological networks.</jats:p><jats:p>In this study, we present PhenoGeneRanker, an improved version of a recently developed network propagation method called Random Walk with Restart on Multiplex Heterogeneous Networks (RWR-MH). PhenoGeneRanker allows multi-layer gene and disease networks. It also calculates empirical p-values of gene ranking using random stratified sampling of genes based on their connectivity degree in the network.</jats:p><jats:p>We ran PhenoGeneRanker using multi-omics datasets of rice to effectively prioritize the cold tolerance-related genes. We observed that top genes selected by PhenoGeneRanker were enriched in cold tolerance-related Gene Ontology (GO) terms whereas bottom ranked genes were enriched in general GO terms only. We also observed that top-ranked genes exhibited significant p-values suggesting that their rankings were independent of their degree in the network.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>CCS CONCEPTS</jats:title><jats:p>• Bioinformatics • Biological networks • System biology • Computational genomics</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title><jats:p>The source code is available on GitHub at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://github.com/bozdaglab/PhenoGeneRanker\">https://github.com/bozdaglab/PhenoGeneRanker</jats:ext-link> under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Contact</jats:title><jats:p><jats:email>cdursun@mcw.edu</jats:email> or <jats:email>serdar.bozdag@marquette.edu</jats:email></jats:p></jats:sec>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The ability to computationally predict whether a compound treats a disease would improve the economy and success rate of drug approval. This study describes Project Rephetio to systematically model drug efficacy based on 755 existing treatments. First, we constructed Hetionet (neo4j.het.io), an integrative network encoding knowledge from millions of biomedical studies. Hetionet v1.0 consists of 47,031 nodes of 11 types and 2,250,197 relationships of 24 types. Data were integrated from 29 public resources to connect compounds, diseases, genes, anatomies, pathways, biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, pharmacologic classes, side effects, and symptoms. Next, we identified network patterns that distinguish treatments from non-treatments. Then, we predicted the probability of treatment for 209,168 compound–disease pairs (het.io/repurpose). Our predictions validated on two external sets of treatment and provided pharmacological insights on epilepsy, suggesting they will help prioritize drug repurposing candidates. This study was entirely open and received realtime feedback from 40 community members.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Many methods have been proposed for facilitating the uncovering of genes that underlie the pathology of different diseases. Some are purely statistical, resulting in a (mostly) undifferentiated set of genes that are differentially expressed (or co-expressed), while others seek to prioritize the resulting set of genes through comparison against specific known targets. Most of the recent approaches use either single data or knowledge sources, or combine the independent predictions from each source. However, given that multiple kinds of heterogeneous sources are potentially relevant for gene prioritization, each subject to different levels of noise and of varying reliability, each source bearing information not carried by another, we claim that an ideal prioritization method should provide ways to discern amongst them in a true integrative fashion that captures the subtleties of each, rather than using a simple combination of sources. Integration of multiple data for gene prioritization is thus more challenging than its single data type counterpart. What we propose is a novel, general, and flexible formulation that enables multi-source data integration for gene prioritization that maximizes the complementary nature of different data and knowledge sources in order to make the most use of the information content of aggregate data. Protein-protein interactions and Gene Ontology annotations were used as knowledge sources, together with assay-specific gene expression and genome-wide association data. Leave-one-out testing was performed using a known set of Alzheimer's Disease genes to validate our proposed method. We show that our proposed method performs better than the best multi-source gene prioritization systems currently published.",
